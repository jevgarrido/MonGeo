# MonGeo User's Guide

## Instructions

The user documentation for MonGeo is available in the form of Markdown files in this directory under `./src/` 

For an interactive experience, you may choose to compile the documentation into a browser-readable book via mdBook and read it in your favourite browser.
For that use the following commands
```
$ cd ~/MonGeo/doc/
$ mdbook serve --open
```
